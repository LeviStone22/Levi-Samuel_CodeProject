# Levi-Samuel_CodeProject
Final Coding Project in CSCI-1250

This is our final project in CSCI, and it is a text-based adventure game. We are going to be utilizing GitHub for this project for easy transfer of the project files
to each other. This will create a really streamlined environment for our workload and hopefully allow us to collaborate more freely and smoothly.
